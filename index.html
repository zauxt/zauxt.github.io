            Hey! My name is Ben Bush and I'm a student at USC studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about learning about anything and everything that has ever and will ever exist and doing the things that make me feel fulfilled along the way. One of my goals is to utilize my skillset in such a way that it positively changes the world around me.

         <p>This paper prototype video is supposed to be like a "USC Community" app. This allows students to view all events in one space, meet new people, and create new experiences. Although tons of information is available through platforms such as GarnetGate and HandShake, this can serve as a medium that includes all types of events (especially informal ones) and a plethora of other things too. Students and faculty can connect in a way that they never quite could before, with chatrooms, events ranging from volunteering to just hanging out, and so much more to dive into with the app.</p>
