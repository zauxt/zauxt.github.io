    <p>This paper prototype video is supposed to be like a "USC Community" app. This allows students to view all events in one space, meet new people, and create new experiences. Although tons of information is available through platforms such as GarnetGate and HandShake, this can serve as a medium that includes all types of events (especially informal ones) and a plethora of other things too. Students and faculty can connect in a way that they never quite could before, with chatrooms, events ranging from volunteering to just hanging out, and so much more to dive into with the app.</p>
